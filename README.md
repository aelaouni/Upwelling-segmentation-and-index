The present code allows you to identify and extract the North-West African upwelling spans (20째51N-36째21N and 4째26W-19째97W).
It also allows you to calculate the spatial and temporal variation of the upwelling index and its spatial extension.

Please cite the following paper if you use the code in your own work:

Instalation notes:


required library:

NetCDF-C https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp

OpenCv-c https://opencv.org/

After you unzipped the files, you'll find 3 folders:


-SstNorm: contains source to calculate the nonlinear normalization of the sea surface temperature.

-Segmentation: contains source to segment the upwelling region.

-Index: contains source to calculate the coastal upwelling index and its extension.

How to compile:

to compile all folders, under terminal execute:

$ make all

To execute an example, under terminal execute:

$ chmod +x run_all.sh

then

$ ./run_all.sh data/sst.nc normalized.nc upwelling.png index.txt  ext.txt

+data/sst.nc: (input) netcdf file of the studied areas (in this example, the Atlantic coast of Morocco) 

+normalized.nc: (output) netcdf file; normalized sst 

+upwelling.png: (output) image of the upwelling area

+index.txt: (output) upwelling index

+ext.txt: (output) upwelling extension
