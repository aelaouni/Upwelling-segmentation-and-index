Instalation notes:


required library:

NetCDF-C https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp

OpenCv-c https://opencv.org/

After you unzipped the files, you'll find 3 folders:

-SstNorm: use the codes inside to calculate the nonlinear normalization of the sea surface temperature.

-Segmentation: use the codes inside to segment the upwelling region.

-Index: use the code inside to calculate the coastal upwelling index.



all the folder contain an example of use.
