The present code allows you to identify and extract the North-West African upwelling spans (20째51N-36째21N and 4째26W-19째97W).
It also allows you to calculate the spatial and temporal variation of the upwelling index and its spatial extension.

Please cite the following paper if you use the code in your own work:

Instalation notes:


required library:

NetCDF-C https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp

OpenCv-c https://opencv.org/

After you unzipped the files, you'll find 3 folders:


-SstNorm: use the codes inside to calculate the nonlinear normalization of the sea surface temperature.

-Segmentation: use the codes inside to segment the upwelling region.

-Index: use the code inside to calculate the coastal upwelling index and its extension.



all the folders contain an example of use.
